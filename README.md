# Sparkify: Churn Prediction for a Music Streaming Service

## Libraries needed for Import
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
 - PySpark SQL
 - PySpark ML 
 
- Only need Anaconda with Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in predicting customer churn for Sparkify, a fictitious music streaming service.

The project entailed: - Loading and cleaning a small subset (128MB) of a larger available dataset
- Conducting exploratory data analysis to better understand the data and determine which features are useful for predicting churn.
- Feature Engineering, which involves creating features that will be used in the modeling process. 
- Modeling with machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Linear SVM.

## File Descriptions
To demonstrate my work in predicting churn, I have one Jupyternotebook with markdown cells were used throughout to explain my processes.

By weighing F1 score and accuracy metrics, the best model was determined to be a Random Forest Classifier.
The final model received an F1 rating and an Accuracy score of 0.75.
